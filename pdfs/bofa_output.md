I thank all my teammates for another great year, and together we look forward to driving the company forward in 2025 against the backdrop of a solid economic environment."

- Net loss of $407 million improved from a net loss of $3.8 billion in 4Q23, driven primarily by the absence of the 4Q23 FDIC special assessment and BSBY cessation charges, and the benefit of a $0.3 billion release of the FDIC special assessment accrual in 4Q24⁽ᶜ⁾

- Total corporate effective tax rate (ETR) for the quarter was approximately 6%
  - Excluding discrete tax items and recurring tax credits primarily related to investments in renewable energy and affordable housing, the ETR would have been approximately 26%

A. We also measure NII and revenue, net of interest expense, on an FTE basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. FTE basis is a performance measure used in operating the business that management believes provides investors with meaningful information on the interest margin for comparative purposes. We believe that this presentation allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. NII on an FTE basis was $14.5 billion, $14.1 billion, $13.9 billion, $14.2 billion and $14.1 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2024, September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Revenue, net of interest expense, on an FTE basis, was $25.5 billion, $25.5 billion and $22.1 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2024, September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The FTE adjustment was $154 million, $147 million and $145 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024, September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

B. We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (KPIs) that management uses when assessing consolidated and/or segment results. We believe this information is useful because it provides management and investors with information about underlying operational performance and trends. KPIs are presented in Consolidated and Business Segment Highlights on page 1, Balance Sheet, Liquidity, and Capital Highlights on page 9 and on the Segment pages for each segment.

C. In 4Q23, the FDIC imposed a special assessment to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund arising from the protection of uninsured depositors of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank associated with their closures. Accordingly, the Corporation recorded pretax noninterest expense of $2.1B in 4Q23 for its estimated assessment amount. Additionally, the Corporation recorded a net pretax charge of $1.6B in 4Q23 to noninterest income related to interest rate swaps used in cash flow hedges of certain loans that are indexed to the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY) following the 4Q23 announcement that BSBY would permanently cease effective November 15, 2024. The Corporation has presented certain non-GAAP financial measures (labeled as "adj." in the tables below) that exclude the impacts of the FDIC special assessment (FDIC SA) and/or the BSBY charge, and has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures as set forth below. The Corporation believes the use of non-GAAP financial measures adjusting for the impact of the FDIC SA and the BSBY charge provide additional information for evaluating its results of operations and comparing its operational performance between periods by excluding these impacts that may not be reflective of its underlying operating performance.

4. Calculated as net income applicable to common shareholders divided by average common shareholders' equity. Average common shareholders' equity was $255B and $260B for 2023 and 4Q23.
5. Calculated as net income applicable to common shareholders divided by average tangible common shareholders' equity. Average tangible common shareholders' equity was $185B and $190B for 2023 and 4Q23. Average tangible common shareholders' equity represents a non-GAAP financial measure.

6. Calculated as noninterest expense divided by revenue, net of interest expense.

D. Reserve build (or release) is calculated by subtracting net charge-offs for the period from the provision for credit losses recognized in that period. The period-end allowance, or reserve, for credit losses reflects the beginning of the period allowance adjusted for net charge-offs recorded in that period plus the provision for credit losses and other valuation accounts recognized in that period.

E. Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) include cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities, inclusive of U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities, and other investment-grade securities, and are readily available to meet funding requirements as they arise. It does not include Federal Reserve Discount Window or Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing capacity. Transfers of liquidity among legal entities may be subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions.

F. Regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2024 are preliminary. The Corporation reports regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. Capital adequacy is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Corporation's binding ratio was the Total capital ratio under the Standardized approach for all periods presented.

G. The below table includes Global Markets sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude this item is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.

H. Pretax, pre-provision income (PTPI) is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by adjusting consolidated pretax income to add back provision for credit losses. Management believes that PTPI is a useful financial measure as it enables an assessment of the Company's ability to generate earnings to cover credit losses through a credit cycle and provides an additional basis for comparing the Company's results of operations between periods by isolating the impact of provision for credit losses, which can vary significantly between periods.

Selected Financial Data (continued)
(Dollars in millions)

| Capital Management | December 31 2024 | September 30 2024 | December 31 2023 |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Regulatory capital metrics (4): | | | |
| Common equity tier 1 capital | $201,083 | $199,805 | $194,928 |
| Common equity tier 1 capital ratio - Standardized approach | 11.9% | 11.8% | 11.8% |
| Common equity tier 1 capital ratio - Advanced approaches | 13.5 | 13.5 | 13.4 |
| Total capital ratio - Standardized approach | 15.1 | 14.9 | 15.2 |
| Total capital ratio - Advanced approaches | 16.4 | 16.3 | 16.6 |
| Tier 1 leverage ratio | 6.9 | 6.9 | 7.1 |
| Supplementary leverage ratio | 5.9 | 5.9 | 6.1 |
| Total ending equity to total ending assets ratio | 9.1 | 8.9 | 9.2 |
| Common equity ratio | 8.4 | 8.2 | 8.3 |
| Tangible equity ratio(5) | 7.1 | 7.0 | 7.1 |
| Tangible common equity ratio (5) | 6.3 | 6.2 | 6.2 |

(1) Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity and tangible book value per share of common stock are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. See Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on page 20.

(2) Ratios do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. Charge-off ratios are annualized for the quarterly presentation.

(3) Balances do not include past due consumer credit card loans, consumer loans secured by real estate where repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration and individually insured long-term stand-by agreements (fully-insured home loans), and in general, other consumer and commercial loans not secured by real estate, and nonperforming loans held-for-sale or accounted for under the fair value option.

(4) Regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2024 are preliminary. Bank of America Corporation reports regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. Capital adequacy is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Corporation's binding ratio was the Total capital ratio under the Standardized approach for all periods presented.

(5) Tangible equity ratio equals period-end tangible shareholders' equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible common equity ratio equals period-end tangible common shareholders' equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible shareholders' equity and tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. See Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on page 20.

Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures
(Dollars in millions, except per share information)

The Corporation evaluates its business using certain non-GAAP financial measures, including pretax, pre-provision income (as defined in Endnote H on page 11) and ratios that utilize tangible equity and tangible assets, each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities ("adjusted" shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity). Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders' equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by total tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities). Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders' equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders' equity divided by total tangible assets. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals.

See the tables below for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures defined by GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the three months ended December 31, 2024, September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Corporation believes the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in understanding its results of operations and trends. Other companies may define or calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently.
